# project-submission

To submit your final project update your GitHub project repository to contain
all of the required documents and ensure they are formatted properly. Also 
include the *final essay* in your documents directory.
**Refer back to the proposal guide for full instructions** on how your 
repository should be structured. For example, you should have the four required
directories and your README file must contain a set of defined instructions. 


### Final project essay

The final project essay is due on May 11th at the same time as your final 
project. Create a markdown document and save it as `documents/final.md`. In this file 
write short answers to the following questions: 


+ Now that you have seen many full research projects saved online as GitHub
repositories do you plan to use GitHub for your future projects as a way 
to store code and data in the cloud and to share your progress with others?


+ Did you project accomplish the goals that you set out for yourself in your
proposal? If not, why? What was the hardest problem in your project that were 
able to overcome? What, if any, was a problem that you were unable to overcome
in your project within the given time?


+ Do you feel that you've learned the skills necessary perform data analysis 
in Python, and to write your own program or pipeline for data analysis? What 
skills do you think you need to work on further, and where would you look to 
find more information about learning these skills?



### Final code review

The final code review is due on May 11th. Please wait until at least May 6th to 
complete the code review so that the projects are more developed. Create a markdown document and save it as `documents/code-review.md`. In this file write short answers to the following questions. Choose three projects from the links listed below to review when answering these questions: 

+ In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made 
it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you 
think that your README file does a good job at this?

+ Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named `project`, and were
you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?

+ Did your peer provide example notebooks in the `notebooks` directory? Does 
the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you 
able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your
peer is trying to solve in the notebook?

+ Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing 
your peer's project directories?
